## OCR

**OCR** stands for "Optical Character Recognition." It is a technology that recognizes text within a digital image. It is commonly used to recognize text in scanned documents and images. 

## Approach

Line detection is been done by sorting pixel values horizontally first, and then vertically after initialising the distance parameter between two frequent lines.
