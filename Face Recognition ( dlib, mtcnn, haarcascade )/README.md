 Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face. These details, such as distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database. The data about a particular face is often called a face template and is distinct from a photograph because it’s designed to only include certain details that can be used to distinguish one face from another. 

### Pre-Trained Face Landmark Detection 

#### Faster Face Detector :

**HaarCascade Classifiers** files is been used for face detection 

#### Faster Face Landmark Detection :

**5 Facial Landmark Datector** files is used for faster detection of face landmark/face information.

#### For Accurate Datection :

**68 Facial Landmark Detector** files is used for accuracte detection of face landmark/information

#### MTCNN :

**MTCNN** is use for similar purpose as HaarCascade Classifiers, but due to its scaling efficiency for detecting faces it's computationaly time consuming process.
