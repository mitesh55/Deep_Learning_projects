# Deep Learning
**Deep learning** is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions. Deep learning AI is able to learn without human supervision, drawing from data that is both unstructured and unlabeled

**OpenCV** is an opensoure computer vision and machine learning library to process and analyse images and videos.

* We will mainly be using **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow** for most of our project's code.

* In this Repository, we'll mainly focuses on the Intermediate level Computer Vision's project to take grasp on topics which are in real time use enormously.
